In 2014, Rezaian — then The Washington Post’s Tehran bureau chief — was arrested with his wife at their home and detained in Iran’s notorious Evin Prison. He joins host Megan McArdle to discuss his time in captivity, Iran’s trajectory since his release, and what his experience reveals about press freedom — and its fragility — around the world. Read more in Rezaian’s book, “Prisoner: My 544 Days in an Iranian Prison.”</description><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 11:00:00 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>For now, New England needs fossil fuels</title><link>https://archive.is/o/lkW9s/https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2026/01/28/oil-snow-energy-snow-storm-fossil-fuels/</link><guid>https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2026/01/28/oil-snow-energy-snow-storm-fossil-fuels/</guid><description>Oil helped keep homes warm during this week’s cold snap.</description><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 10:45:27 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>These gun rights groups got the response to Alex Pretti’s killing right</title><link>https://archive.is/o/lkW9s/https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2026/01/27/gun-rights-alex-pretti-nra-minneapolis/</link><guid>https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2026/01/27/gun-rights-alex-pretti-nra-minneapolis/</guid><description>A show of Second Amendment principle.</description><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 23:07:00 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Maryland is getting a Sphere — and wasting millions in public subsidies</title><link>https://archive.is/o/lkW9s/https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2026/01/27/sphere-maryland-national-harbor-pg-subsidies/</link><guid>https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2026/01/27/sphere-maryland-national-harbor-pg-subsidies/</guid><description>Wes Moore is wrong to compel Wizards and Caps fans to enrich the owner of the Knicks and Rangers.</description><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 22:43:58 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Americans should not trust ICE.
