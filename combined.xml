In 2014, Rezaian — then The Washington Post’s Tehran bureau chief — was arrested with his wife at their home and detained in Iran’s notorious Evin Prison. He joins host Megan McArdle to discuss his time in captivity, Iran’s trajectory since his release, and what his experience reveals about press freedom — and its fragility — around the world. Read more in Rezaian’s book, “Prisoner: My 544 Days in an Iranian Prison.”</description><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 11:00:00 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>For now, New England needs fossil fuels</title><link>https://archive.is/o/lkW9s/https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2026/01/28/oil-snow-energy-snow-storm-fossil-fuels/</link><guid>https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2026/01/28/oil-snow-energy-snow-storm-fossil-fuels/</guid><description>Oil helped keep homes warm during this week’s cold snap.</description><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 10:45:27 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>These gun rights groups got the response to Alex Pretti’s killing right</title><link>https://archive.is/o/lkW9s/https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2026/01/27/gun-rights-alex-pretti-nra-minneapolis/</link><guid>https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2026/01/27/gun-rights-alex-pretti-nra-minneapolis/</guid><description>A show of Second Amendment principle.</description><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 23:07:00 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Maryland is getting a Sphere — and wasting millions in public subsidies</title><link>https://archive.is/o/lkW9s/https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2026/01/27/sphere-maryland-national-harbor-pg-subsidies/</link><guid>https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2026/01/27/sphere-maryland-national-harbor-pg-subsidies/</guid><description>Wes Moore is wrong to compel Wizards and Caps fans to enrich the owner of the Knicks and Rangers.</description><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 22:43:58 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Assume this loutocracy is lying about ICE until proven otherwise</title><link>https://archive.is/o/lkW9s/https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2026/01/27/trump-noem-deportation-ice-border-control-minneapolis/</link><guid>https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2026/01/27/trump-noem-deportation-ice-border-control-minneapolis/</guid><description>Kristi Noem isn’t the only reason millions of Americans increasingly distrust the deportation mania.</description><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 21:08:03 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Democrats must learn to say ‘all of the above’ on energy</title><link>https://archive.is/o/lkW9s/https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2026/01/27/energy-cost-affordable-bipartisan/</link><guid>https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2026/01/27/energy-cost-affordable-bipartisan/</guid><description>Readers on clean and affordable energy, U.N. climate policy and more.</description><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 20:51:29 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Cartoon by Matt Davies</title><link>https://archive.is/o/lkW9s/https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2026/01/27/matt-davies-cartoon-snow-storm-ice/</link><guid>https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2026/01/27/matt-davies-cartoon-snow-storm-ice/</guid><description>Matt Davies cartoon on weather forecasts and Immigrations and Customs Enforcement.</description><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 18:08:39 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>An obsession with the wrong resources is distracting America</title><link>https://archive.is/o/lkW9s/https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2026/01/27/america-strategic-resource-ideas/</link><guid>https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2026/01/27/america-strategic-resource-ideas/</guid><description>The country’s durable advantage is the ability to generate ideas.</description><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 12:00:33 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Mike Pompeo: America is looking at a dangerous gamble in Syria</title><link>https://archive.is/o/lkW9s/https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2026/01/27/us-syria-withdrawal-pompeo/</link><guid>https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2026/01/27/us-syria-withdrawal-pompeo/</guid><description>The situation threatens Trump’s achievements on regional security.</description><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 11:45:54 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>By leaving the WHO, Trump is squandering U.S. security</title><link>https://archive.is/o/lkW9s/https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2026/01/27/trump-world-health-organization-security-risk/</link><guid>https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2026/01/27/trump-world-health-organization-security-risk/</guid><description>Americans will face more public health threats at home and will be less safe traveling, engaging in commerce or serving overseas.</description><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 11:30:27 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>A toxic mushroom is gaining popularity</title><link>https://archive.is/o/lkW9s/https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2026/01/27/psychedelic-mushrooms-amanita-dangers-risk/</link><guid>https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2026/01/27/psychedelic-mushrooms-amanita-dangers-risk/</guid><description>Don’t fall for the false marketing of potentially toxic amanita mushrooms.</description><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 11:30:24 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>I tested four AI browsers.
