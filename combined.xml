City living isn't for everyone, but it's amazing for the people who want it. Unless, that is, they also want a family.

Today's cities are designed for demographic churn — as a rest stop en route to the suburbs, rather than a place you can live a full life. That's bad for families and for America. Bobby Fijan is one of the people trying to fix that. He is the co-founder of The American Housing Corporation, a real estate development company building affordable, family-sized rowhomes in cities across America.

Fijan joins host Megan McArdle to explain how urban housing pushed families out of cities and how his company plans to bring them back.</description><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 11:00:00
