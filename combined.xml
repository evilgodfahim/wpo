He's a serial entrepreneur who cashed in on the dot-com boom and has pushed back on over-regulation of artificial intelligence and the tech industry. He’s in favor of abortion rights, but was against overregulation of mask mandates. He's pro-business and pro-weed. The “pro-liberty” governor joins host Megan McArdle to discuss Trump’s tariff and immigration policies, transgender care and how to make housing and health care more affordable.</description><pubDate>Wed, 17 Dec 2025 11:30:00 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>The law that is trapping America in the past</title><link>https://archive.is/o/9JpVp/https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2025/12/17/nepa-environment-infrastructure-delays-congress/</link><guid>https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2025/12/17/nepa-environment-infrastructure-delays-congress/</guid><description>NEPA’s review process delays desperately needed infrastructure projects for years.</description><pubDate>Wed, 17 Dec 2025 11:15:11 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>America can lead on AI by heeding these three truths</title><link>https://archive.is/o/9JpVp/https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2025/12/17/artificial-intelligence-laws/</link><guid>https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2025/12/17/artificial-intelligence-laws/</guid><description>A new AI road map can protect people, power start-ups and compete with China.</description><pubDate>Wed, 17 Dec 2025 11:00:00 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Caring for elders is hard.
