Protests erupted almost immediately, reviving the Iraq War–era slogan, “no blood for oil.”

Host Megan McArdle breaks down the long, troubled history of Venezuelan oil and explains why the U.S. has a responsibility to help rebuild the country's economy.</description><pubDate>Sat, 10 Jan 2026 11:30:00 +0000</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
