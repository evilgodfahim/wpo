In 2014, Rezaian — then The Washington Post’s Tehran bureau chief — was arrested with his wife at their home and detained in Iran’s notorious Evin Prison. He joins host Megan McArdle to discuss his time in captivity, Iran’s trajectory since his release, and what his experience reveals about press freedom — and its fragility — around the world. Read more in Rezaian’s book, “Prisoner: My 544 Days in an Iranian Prison.”</description><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 11:00:00 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>For now, New England needs fossil fuels</title><link>https://archive.is/o/lkW9s/https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2026/01/28/oil-snow-energy-snow-storm-fossil-fuels/</link><guid>https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2026/01/28/oil-snow-energy-snow-storm-fossil-fuels/</guid><description>Oil helped keep homes warm during this week’s cold snap.</description><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 10:45:27 +0000</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
