Later that day, President Donald Trump said the United States would take control of Venezuela’s massive oil reserves. Protests erupted almost immediately, reviving the Iraq War–era slogan, “no blood for oil.”

Host Megan McArdle breaks down the long, troubled history of Venezuelan oil and explains why the U.S. has a responsibility to help rebuild the country's economy.</description><pubDate>Sat, 10 Jan 2026 11:30:00 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>The Chicago Teachers Union’s New Year’s resolution: more mediocrity</title><link>https://archive.is/o/lkW9s/https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2026/01/10/chicago-teachers-union-ctu-schools/</link><guid>https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2026/01/10/chicago-teachers-union-ctu-schools/</guid><description>If the union really cares about justice, it should focus on teaching students how to read and write.</description><pubDate>Sat, 10 Jan 2026 10:45:40 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>The Iranian regime is caught in a death spiral</title><link>https://archive.is/o/lkW9s/https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2026/01/09/iran-regime-ayatollah-tehran-unrest/</link><guid>https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2026/01/09/iran-regime-ayatollah-tehran-unrest/</guid><description>Tehran tamps down the unrest again, but the protesters will be back.</description><pubDate>Sat, 10 Jan 2026 00:28:25 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>The problem with national dietary guidelines</title><link>https://archive.is/o/lkW9s/https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2026/01/09/dietary-guidelines-nutrition-education-rfk-alcohol/</link><guid>https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2026/01/09/dietary-guidelines-nutrition-education-rfk-alcohol/</guid><description>What politicians call ‘nutritional’ feels overly political.</description><pubDate>Fri, 09 Jan 2026 23:02:33 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>I voted for Trump.
