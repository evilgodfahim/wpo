City living isn't for everyone, but it's amazing for the people who want it. Unless, that is, they also want a family.

Today's cities are designed for demographic churn — as a rest stop en route to the suburbs, rather than a place you can live a full life. That's bad for families and for America. Bobby Fijan is one of the people trying to fix that. He is the co-founder of The American Housing Corporation, a real estate development company building affordable, family-sized rowhomes in cities across America.

Fijan joins host Megan McArdle to explain how urban housing pushed families out of cities and how his company plans to bring them back.</description><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 11:00:00 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Trump’s target was Canada, but Michigan takes the hit</title><link>https://archive.is/o/lkW9s/https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2026/02/04/michigan-tariffs-trade-war-canada/</link><guid>https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2026/02/04/michigan-tariffs-trade-war-canada/</guid><description>The collateral damage of tariffs</description><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 10:45:33 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>This good compromise would rein in ICE without undermining its core job</title><link>https://archive.is/o/lkW9s/https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2026/02/03/shutdown-dhs-ice-funding-spending-compromise/</link><guid>https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2026/02/03/shutdown-dhs-ice-funding-spending-compromise/</guid><description>Ten days to avoid another shutdown.</description><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 23:30:40 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>A new ruler for the Magic Kingdom</title><link>https://archive.is/o/lkW9s/https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2026/02/03/new-disney-ceo-damaro-iger-streaming-challenges/</link><guid>https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2026/02/03/new-disney-ceo-damaro-iger-streaming-challenges/</guid><description>Disney’s pick to replace Bob Iger reflects the iconic brand’s urgency to evolve or die.</description><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 21:50:22 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>How Eleanor Holmes Norton stepped into a dangerous moment in history</title><link>https://archive.is/o/lkW9s/https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2026/02/03/eleanor-holmes-norton-iran-crime-cannabis-reform/</link><guid>https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2026/02/03/eleanor-holmes-norton-iran-crime-cannabis-reform/</guid><description>Iran, crime, cannabis reform and Eleanor Holmes Norton’s retirement, in readers’ eyes.</description><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 21:25:33 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Cartoon by Jimmy Margulies</title><link>https://archive.is/o/lkW9s/https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2026/02/03/jimmy-margulies-cartoon-epstein-uncle-sam-doj/</link><guid>https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2026/02/03/jimmy-margulies-cartoon-epstein-uncle-sam-doj/</guid><description>Jimmy Margulies cartoon on Uncle Sam and the Epstein files.</description><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 17:23:22 +0000</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
